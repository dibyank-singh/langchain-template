# LangChain Template

Welcome to the **LangChain Template** repository! This template is designed to help developers quickly get started with the LangChain framework, providing a modular and scalable foundation for building powerful language model-driven applications.

## Overview

### What Is This Template?

This template serves as a starter kit for creating applications using the LangChain framework. It comes with pre-configured setups for chains, agents, and utility functions, enabling you to focus on developing your application rather than setting up the basics. The template is organized to be easily understandable and extensible, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.

### Problem Statement

**Problem:** Setting up a project with the LangChain framework can be time-consuming and complex, especially for new developers or those looking to rapidly prototype ideas. Common challenges include:

- **Project Structure**: Organizing the codebase in a way that is both scalable and maintainable.
- **Environment Setup**: Configuring the environment with the necessary dependencies, API keys, and tools.
- **Chain and Agent Creation**: Writing and configuring custom chains and agents from scratch.
- **Integration with Vector Databases**: Setting up a vector database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks.
- **Testing and Validation**: Ensuring that the components work as expected through unit tests and CI/CD pipelines.

### Solution

The **LangChain Template** addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Modular Project Structure**: A clean and organized directory layout that separates chains, agents, prompts, utilities, and data.
- **Pre-configured Chains and Agents**: Ready-to-use chains and agents that can be easily extended or customized for your specific use cases.
- **Environment Setup Tools**: A `config.py` for centralized configuration management, along with example environment variables to simplify the setup process.
- **Docker Support**: Docker and Docker Compose files for easy containerized deployment, making it simple to run the application in any environment.
- **Sample Data and Examples**: Example data, prompts, and usage scenarios to help you get started quickly.
- **Testing Framework**: Unit tests and a CI/CD setup to ensure your components are reliable and your codebase remains clean.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: Clearly defined directories and modules for easy navigation and extension.
- **Pre-built Chains and Agents**: Examples of different LangChain components, ready to be adapted to your needs.
- **Docker Integration**: Simple setup for running the application in a containerized environment.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive tutorials and examples to help you learn and experiment with LangChain.
- **CI/CD Setup**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines to maintain code quality.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive README and in-code comments to guide you through every step.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- **Docker (optional)**: For containerized deployment, make sure Docker is installed.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-template.git
   cd langchain-template
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py

 2. **Running with Docker**:
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```


### Access the Application:

The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) (or the port you configure).

## Usage

- **Chains**: Explore the `chains/` directory to see how to create and run different chains.
- **Agents**: Check the `agents/` directory for examples of agents that can perform various tasks.
- **Prompts**: Modify the `prompts/` directory to create custom prompt templates.
- **Utilities**: Utilize the functions in the `utils/` directory to simplify your workflow.
